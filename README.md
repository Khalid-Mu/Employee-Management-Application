----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of the project is to implement a mobile application by using the Android Studio 
platform and connecting it to an online database. Our application proposed an Employee 
Management System which has four main operations which are Add, Edit, Delete and retrieve
the data to represent it in our application. In add employee, the user will be asked to write an 
employee data which is Id, Name, Age, Years of experience, and Salary, then by clicking in 
button add the data will be added into the database and it will be represented later in the list of 
employee data. In delete employee, the user needs to press the delete button on a specific 
employee in the list then it will come a message to confirm the delete operation whether if the 
user want to continue or not. In edit employee, the user needs to press the edit button in a 
specific employee in the list then the employee data will be represented then the user will choose 
a specific attribute to edit it. The retrieve operation will be represented on the home page of our 
application. For the add, delete, and edit operations every change on the employee data by these 
operations it will show up in the firebase database and the home page of the application.
